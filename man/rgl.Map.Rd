\title{ Plot a map in an rgl window }
\description{
  Plots a map (from a Map object from package maptools) on a unit sphere
  in an rgl window that can then be interactively rotated.
}
\usage{
rgl.Map(Map, which, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{Map}{ A \code{Map} object }
  \item{which}{ Vector indicating the subset of polygons to plot. }
  \item{\dots}{ Additional arguments passed on to \code{rgl.lines}. }
}
\details{
  This assumes that the map is cordinates in degrees and plots the map
  on a unit sphere in an rgl window making a globe.  You can then rotate
  the globe by clicking and dragging in the window.
}
\value{
  There is no return value, this function is run for its side effect.

\note{ This function is still beta level software (some extra lines show
up).  This needs to be updated to use the new spatial objects, you can
use it as an idea, but probably won't work directly.}
